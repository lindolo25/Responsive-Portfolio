                    <p>This where I write something about me. as I said in class, born and raised in Cuba, came to US 4 years ago. Currently working as Filed Engineer for a local MSP (Managed Service Provider) company in the Miami area. I really enjoy the tech support work, but I always had a passion for writing code. I had use code as part of my Job in different ways: mainly to automate tasks for users, for schedule task on servers, to migrate data and files as part of a server migration project, etc.</p>
                    <p>Sign up for this Bootcamp to make me ready for a job as a software Development. To learn JavaScript and news technologies related to web development that are unfamiliar to me. To learn how to code in a team rather than by myself and use collaboration tools and methodologies.</p>
